    "Tidal stripping is an astrophysical phenomenon which occurs when galaxies come within gravitationally significant distances. The galaxy of larger mass will significantly influence the stars of the other galaxy, sometimes removing or capturing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a few simplifying assumptions and knowledge of the solution to the two-body problem, tidal stripping can be simulated accurately enough to explore the phenomenon. Firstly, we assume Newtonian mechanics, which means bodies in the presence of two gravitational fields will travel in ellipses, which we can numerically solve for quite easily. Next let us consider the gravitational field of the galaxies to dominate those of the individual stars. Thus our stars become test particles only under the influence of two gravitational fields.\n",
